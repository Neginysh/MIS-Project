1. just one of swipes could be selected. when one is selected, the other one is disabled.
2. I made the fragments unSwipeable because: 1. swipe buttons will work 2. participants don't go back to previous questions (remove)
3. to remove focus from edittext I added a LinearLayout with width and height of 0. and : android:focusable="true" . then the focus is first on this layout. when the user clicks on edittext the focus would be on edittext 
	// To calculate the time typing the answer in edittext the time is considered from when the user taps on editttext(Focus) till the last change they make on edittext
